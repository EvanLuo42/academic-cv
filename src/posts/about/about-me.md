## About Me

I’m a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a Stanford Data Science Scholar. Stanford Data Science Scholars are early-career researchers from all parts of the University who are using and developing data science methods in their research.

I’m interested in Organizational Behavior, with a special interest in Leadership and Managing Groups and Teams. In addition to my substantive work in Organizational Behavior, I’m interested in meta-science and methods. My favorite letter in the alphabet is , and I am weirdly evangelical about it. In my free time, I enjoy hot yoga, deadlifting, hiking, and taking board games much too seriously.
